// Dear maintainer: <br/>
// When I wrote any of this code, only I and God <br/>
// knew what it was. <br/>
// Now, only God knows! <br/>
// <br/>
// So if you are done trying to 'optimize' <br/>
// this routine (and failed). <br/>
// please increment the following counter <br/>
// as a warning <br/>
// to the next guy: <br/>
//<br/>

// total_hours_wasted_here = ![counter](https://test.jm26.net/api/github-profile-counter.php?type=image "counter")
