If you are using some of my projects and you don't know what is wrong with the code change this counter: total hours wasted = <img src="https://test.jm26.net/api/github-profile-counter.php?type=badge" alt="counter" title="counter" height="20px">
<a href="https://test.jm26.net/api/github-profile-counter.php" target="_blank">INCREASE HOURS</a></p>

<p>This is really scary, isn&#39;t it? 😱</p>
<p>Think about it: <br/>
    just by adding a image to my README.md, I can get informations about you. <br/>
    In this case it's Githubs IP Address, because they are using a proxy. <br/>
    But if you are on a site that doesn't use a proxy, anyone can get your IP Address. <br/>
</p>
<p>But don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t do anything with this data. (I don&#39;t even save it) <br/>
    I just want to show you how easy it is to get informations about you. <br/>
</p>
<p>BTW this project is open source. <br/>
    You can check it out here: <a href="https://go.jm26.net/github-user-informations">github.com/jmcrafter26/user-informations</a> <br/>
