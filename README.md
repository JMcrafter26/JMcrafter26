// Dear maintainer: 
// When I wrote any of this code, only I and God 
// knew what it was. 
// Now, only God knows! 
// 
// So if you are done trying to 'optimize' 
// this routine (and failed). 
// please increment the following counter 
// as a warning 
// to the next guy: 
//
// total_hours_wasted_here = 67
